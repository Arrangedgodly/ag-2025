    image: "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3758805720_10.jpg",
    description: `Taxed, Tolled & Eternally Trolled is a 3 chapter autobiographical album. 
        It is the story of an ever degrading mentality in a world of capitalistic nightmares awakening at every turn. 
        This is the first album I've done with none of my own beats! It was really exciting and engaging to focus on 
        creating the hardest hitting lyricism I possibly could, while allowing these incredible producers works to 
        shine throughout.`,

    description: `One Seasoned Cracker marks the end of an era for Arranged Godly, the final days before fatherhood 
        and a tread into stability and accountability. It showcases the epiphanies of what life would, 
        could and should be when chakras are properly aligned`,
